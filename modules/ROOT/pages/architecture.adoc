:description: Technical architecture overview of Guardrail Service
:keywords: architecture, design, components, system

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Guardrail Service architecture.

== Overview

The Guardrail Service is designed as a modular, scalable system for policy enforcement and validation.

== Core Components

=== Policy Engine

The policy engine is the heart of the Guardrail Service:

* Evaluates incoming requests against defined policies
* Supports multiple policy languages and formats
* Provides real-time decision making

=== API Gateway

The API gateway handles:

* Request routing
* Authentication and authorization
* Rate limiting and throttling
* Request/response transformation

=== Data Store

The data store manages:

* Policy definitions
* Audit logs
* Configuration data
* Metrics and analytics

== System Architecture

== Deployment Models

=== Standalone Deployment

Suitable for:

* Small to medium workloads
* Development and testing environments
* Single-tenant deployments

=== Distributed Deployment

Recommended for:

* High-availability requirements
* Large-scale production environments
* Multi-tenant scenarios

== Integration Patterns

=== Inline Mode

The service acts as a proxy:

* All traffic passes through Guardrail
* Real-time policy enforcement
* Full request/response inspection

=== Sidecar Mode

Deployed alongside applications:

* Low-latency policy decisions
* Application-specific policies
* Reduced network overhead

=== API Mode

Called as an external service:

* Loose coupling with applications
* Centralized policy management
* Language-agnostic integration

== Security Architecture

=== Authentication

* OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
* API key authentication
* Mutual TLS (mTLS)

=== Authorization

* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
* Policy-based authorization

=== Data Protection

* Encryption at rest
* Encryption in transit
* Audit logging
* Compliance with standards (SOC2, GDPR, etc.)

== Performance Considerations

=== Caching Strategy

* Decision caching for repeated requests
* Policy caching for faster evaluation
* Distributed cache for scalability

=== Optimization Techniques

* Policy compilation and optimization
* Parallel evaluation for complex policies
* Connection pooling and reuse

== Monitoring and Observability

=== Metrics

* Request rate and latency
* Policy evaluation time
* Cache hit/miss rates
* Error rates and types

=== Logging

* Structured logging
* Audit trails
* Debug and trace logging
* Log aggregation support

=== Tracing

* Distributed tracing support
* OpenTelemetry integration
* Request flow visualization
