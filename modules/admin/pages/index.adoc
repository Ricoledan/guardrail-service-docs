:description: System administration guide for Guardrail Service
:keywords: admin, administration, operations, deployment

This guide covers the installation, configuration, and maintenance of the Guardrail Service.

== Overview

The Administration Guide is intended for system administrators and DevOps engineers responsible for:

* Installing and configuring the service
* Managing system resources
* Monitoring performance
* Maintaining security
* Performing upgrades

== Prerequisites

Before administering the Guardrail Service, ensure you have:

* System administrator privileges
* Understanding of your infrastructure
* Access to required resources (databases, networks, etc.)
* Backup and recovery procedures in place

== Deployment Options

=== Container Deployment

Using Docker:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /etc/guardrail:/config \
  guardrail/service:latest
----

Using Kubernetes:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: guardrail-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: guardrail
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: guardrail
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: guardrail
        image: guardrail/service:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
----

=== Bare Metal Installation

For traditional server deployments:

[source,bash]
----
# Download and extract
wget https://releases.guardrail.example.com/latest/guardrail-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf guardrail-linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Install systemd service
sudo cp guardrail.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable guardrail
sudo systemctl start guardrail
----

== System Requirements

=== Minimum Requirements

* CPU: 2 cores
* RAM: 4GB
* Storage: 10GB
* Network: 100Mbps

=== Recommended for Production

* CPU: 8 cores
* RAM: 16GB
* Storage: 100GB SSD
* Network: 1Gbps
* High availability setup with 3+ nodes

== Configuration Management

=== Configuration File

Primary configuration file: `/etc/guardrail/config.yaml`

[source,yaml]
----
server:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 8080
  tls:
    enabled: true
    cert: /etc/guardrail/certs/server.crt
    key: /etc/guardrail/certs/server.key

database:
  type: postgresql
  host: db.example.com
  port: 5432
  name: guardrail
  user: guardrail_user

cache:
  type: redis
  host: cache.example.com
  port: 6379

logging:
  level: info
  format: json
  output: /var/log/guardrail/service.log
----

=== Environment Variables

Override configuration with environment variables:

[source,bash]
----
export GUARDRAIL_SERVER_PORT=8080
export GUARDRAIL_DATABASE_HOST=db.example.com
export GUARDRAIL_LOG_LEVEL=debug
----

== High Availability

=== Multi-Node Setup

Configure multiple nodes for high availability:

. Set up load balancer
. Configure shared database
. Set up distributed cache
. Configure session affinity if needed

=== Database Clustering

Supported database clustering options:

* PostgreSQL with streaming replication
* MySQL with Group Replication
* MongoDB Replica Sets

== Monitoring and Alerting

=== Metrics Export

Enable Prometheus metrics:

[source,yaml]
----
metrics:
  enabled: true
  port: 9090
  path: /metrics
----

=== Health Checks

Health check endpoints:

* `/health` - Basic health check
* `/health/ready` - Readiness check
* `/health/live` - Liveness check

=== Log Management

Configure centralized logging:

[source,yaml]
----
logging:
  level: info
  format: json
  outputs:
    - type: file
      path: /var/log/guardrail/service.log
    - type: syslog
      host: syslog.example.com
      port: 514
----

== Security Hardening

=== Network Security

* Use TLS for all connections
* Implement network segmentation
* Configure firewall rules
* Use private networks for internal communication

=== Access Control

* Implement RBAC
* Use strong authentication
* Enable audit logging
* Regular security audits

== Maintenance Tasks

=== Regular Maintenance

Daily:
* Check service health
* Review error logs
* Monitor resource usage

Weekly:
* Review security logs
* Check for updates
* Verify backups

Monthly:
* Performance analysis
* Capacity planning
* Security patches

=== Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Issue |Solution

|Service won't start
|Check logs, verify configuration, ensure dependencies are running

|High memory usage
|Adjust cache settings, check for memory leaks, scale horizontally

|Slow performance
|Optimize database queries, increase cache, add more nodes

|Connection errors
|Verify network connectivity, check firewall rules, validate certificates
|===

== Disaster Recovery

=== Backup Strategy

* Daily automated backups
* Off-site backup storage
* Regular restore testing
* Document recovery procedures

=== Recovery Procedures

. Stop the service
. Restore database from backup
. Restore configuration files
. Restart service
. Verify functionality
