. Review the xref:policies.adoc[policy documentation]

== Key Concepts

=== Policies

Policies define the rules and constraints that the Guardrail Service enforces. They can be:

* **Allow policies**: Explicitly permit certain actions
* **Deny policies**: Block specific behaviors
* **Conditional policies**: Apply rules based on context

=== Rules

Rules are the building blocks of policies:

* Pattern matching rules
* Value validation rules
* Custom logic rules

=== Actions

Actions determine what happens when a policy is triggered:

* Block the request
* Log the event
* Send an alert
* Transform the request

== Common Use Cases

=== API Security

Protect your APIs by:

* Validating request formats
* Enforcing rate limits
* Blocking malicious patterns

=== Data Validation

Ensure data quality by:

* Checking field formats
* Validating value ranges
* Enforcing business rules

=== Compliance Enforcement

Meet regulatory requirements by:

* Logging all access attempts
* Enforcing data residency rules
* Applying privacy filters

== Best Practices

. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic policies and gradually add complexity
. **Test Thoroughly**: Use the testing environment before production deployment
. **Monitor Actively**: Set up alerts for policy violations
. **Document Policies**: Maintain clear documentation of your policy intent
. **Review Regularly**: Periodically audit and update your policies
